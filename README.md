# [Voyen][repo]â€™s dotfiles

WIP README - coming soon

## Setup

This is really only intended to be used on Ubuntu.

```shell
bash -c "$(wget -qO - https://raw.github.com/Voyen/dotfiles/main/src/os/setup.sh)"
```

## License

The code is available under the [MIT license][license].

## TODO

- [x] Pre-fill git email (same as y/n prompt, no need for enter if selecting y)
- [ ] Add new section for things to install manually - at the end of it all, just provide a bunch of links to the downloads in the script output
  - [ ] Portecle
